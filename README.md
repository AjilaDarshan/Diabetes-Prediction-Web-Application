# Diabetes_Prediction
In This Project, we are building a model that can predict whether any female has diabetes or not by using machine learning.

Dataset:- https://www.dropbox.com/s/a62bx8diafvqn9r/diabetes.csv?dl=0

From this dataset, we have consider 8 features Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction and Age to predict whether any female has Dabetes or Non-Diabetes.
In This Project, we have use Python to implement model.
We use Support Vector Machine model for the prediction and Streamlit to deploy our model.
